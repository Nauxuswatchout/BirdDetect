📌 Project Overview

BirdDetect is a cloud-native web platform designed to provide users with a seamless environment for testing and interacting with AI-powered computer vision models. The system focuses on real-time image upload, automatic object detection, and intelligent tagging, allowing users to evaluate model performance while experiencing a practical, production-ready deployment. By integrating serverless architecture and scalable cloud services, BirdDetect bridges the gap between AI research and real-world applications, making it easier for a broader audience to access, test, and benefit from modern deep learning models.

🚀 Core Features

AI Model Testing Platform: Enables users to upload images and instantly test them with AI-based detection models (e.g., YOLO).

Smart Tagging & Search: Automatically generates descriptive tags for uploaded images and supports flexible search and retrieval through tag-based queries.

Scalable Web Application: Powered by AWS serverless services (S3, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB), ensuring elastic scalability and cost efficiency.

Secure Access: User authentication and authorization handled through AWS Cognito, with optional federated login for broader accessibility.

Interactive Web UI: Clean and user-friendly interface for uploading images, running detection tasks, and viewing results.

Real-time Notifications: Tag-based subscription and event notifications powered by AWS SNS, keeping users informed about relevant image updates.

🏗️ System Architecture

BirdDetect leverages an event-driven serverless architecture to ensure high performance and reliability:

Web UI / API Gateway → Provides user access to upload, query, and view results.

AWS S3 → Stores original images and generated thumbnails.

AWS Lambda → Executes AI inference (YOLO-based detection) and metadata processing.

DynamoDB → Maintains structured records of image URLs and AI-generated tags.

Cognito & IAM → Secures the platform with authentication and fine-grained access control.

SNS Notifications → Delivers updates when new images with specific tags are detected.

This architecture empowers BirdDetect to operate as a scalable, secure, and production-ready AI testing platform, extending its use cases beyond experimentation into real-world AI application delivery.
